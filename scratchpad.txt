refactor Dijkstra.cpp into smaller functions



i should not be doing using namespace std anywhere but let's for now let them remain in .cpp as they are
not included anywhere in my opinion they do not pollute anything like headers.


i am currently trying to do manual memeory allocation
change it to automatic with smart pointers

do i want to use memeber initilizeres

should replace transverseList in Dijkstra to std::list as removeing elements can be expensive if done frequently

// could use iterator based loop in getSmallestFromTransverseList


todo
// there should be a fail fast in addEdge() if edge does not contain this node
// i just debugged for 2 hours man 
// fail fast is very important
