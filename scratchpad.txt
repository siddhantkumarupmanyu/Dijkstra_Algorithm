refactor Dijkstra.cpp into smaller functions

currently getShortestPathFromDestination() return vector by copy should i return it by reference
    -I think it should be returning by copy only
    -so when Dijkstra class is destroyed the shortest path still remains in the calling code
        as its returned by copying

i should not be doing 'using namespace std' anywhere but let's for now let them remain in .cpp as they are
not included anywhere; in my opinion they do not pollute other files like headers.


i am currently trying to do manual memeory allocation
change it to automatic with smart pointers

do i want to use memeber initilizeres

should replace transverseList in Dijkstra to std::list as removing elements can be expensive if done frequently

// could use iterator based loop in getSmallestFromTransverseList


todo
// there should be a fail fast in addEdge() if edge does not contain this node
// i just debugged for 2 hours man 
// fail fast is very important
