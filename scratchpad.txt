i am currently trying to do manual memeory allocation
change it to automatic with smart pointers

should replace transverseList in Dijkstra to std::list as removeing elements can be expensive if done frequently

// could use iterator based loop in getSmallestFromTransverseList


todo
// there should be a fail fast in addEdge() if edge does not contain this node
// i just debugged for 2 hours man 
// fail fast is very important
