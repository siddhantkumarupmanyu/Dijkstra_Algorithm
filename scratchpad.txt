i am currently trying to do manual memeory allocation
change it to automatic with smart pointers

do i need getPrevoiusNode that automatic gives back other node from edgeWithShortestPathToSource??

destinationNode->getEdgeWithSortestPathToSource()->getOtherNode(destinationNode);
    - i should make a method in node to get other node

should replace transverseList in Dijkstra to std::list as removeing elements can be expensive if done frequently

// could use iterator based loop in getSmallestFromTransverseList
